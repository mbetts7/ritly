FEATURES TO ADD:
- fix edit links and iframe
- don't duplicate urls
- Make the preview or url show page contain the number of times someone has used that redirect.
- Allow the user creating the redirect to give a string to use as the shortened string. (localhost:3000/go/my_string redirects to my_url). Make sure to think about possible problems this could cause.
- Make everything gorgeous.


QUESTIONS:
- does preview variable have to be same as redirect variable since it is linking to that?
- http or https?
- why does iframe not work
- why does edit page not work
